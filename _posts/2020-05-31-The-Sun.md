# The Sun

The sunlight flows into my room. It is brigt and I guess it should be called lovely or nice, yet I can not feel it's warmth on my skin. When was the last time I've seen it outside these window frames? When was that last time?...i don't remember

Never thought I'd forget something important like that. Something that seemed to be an unquestionable part of my life now seems alien and weird at least.

Now the sun is simply a large lamp which I can not switch on and off myself. Like an annoying neighbour that's not letting you sleep and you can't persuade him to do his bussines some other time. A self-switching lamp.
